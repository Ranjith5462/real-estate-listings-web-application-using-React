# Real_Estate
The Real Estate Web Application is a platform that allows users to search for properties and list their own properties for sale or rent. The application is built using Python Django for the backend and React for the frontend.
Features:

User authentication: Users can create an account and login to the application using their email and password.

Property search: Users can search for properties using various filters such as location, price range, number of bedrooms, and more. The search results can be displayed on a map or in a list view.

Property listings: Users can list their properties for sale or rent, including details such as the price, number of bedrooms, and a description.

Contact agents: Users can contact real estate agents or property owners directly through the application to ask questions or schedule a viewing.

Favorite properties: Users can save their favorite properties and access them later in their account.

Admin panel: The application will have an admin panel where administrators can manage users, properties, and other aspects of the application.

The Real Estate Web Application will provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for both buyers and sellers to find and list properties. It will also provide a valuable resource for real estate agents to connect with potential clients and showcase their listings.
